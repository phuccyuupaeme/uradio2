    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Why Adobe</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>While on the market to pick up a new hobby, I somehow got the bright idea to purchase a new camera FZ2500 by Panasonic and after doing so, I realized, this is only about 25% of the equipment I need.  I spent countless hours searching for the right software program that would fit all my needs, sufficient enough to keep up with industry standards but not cost an arm and a leg if you know what I mean.  Long story short, I chose Adobe Creative Cloud.  The price was unbeatable (student discount price), the learning curve was very achievable, and last, Adobe's compatibility across platforms and other software programs is astounding. </p>
    <p>Three reasons why I will be using Adobe now and in the distant future

    <p>Three reasons why I will using Adobe now and in the distant future</p>
    <br>*Ease of use
    <br>*Price
    <br>*Quality
        </br>
        <br>
    </br>

        <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Why FL Studio</h2>
        Before I begin, let me say "Why not FL Studio"? No but seriously, FL Studio is the most user friendly, very compatible beat making software that I have ever come across and I have used many different ones, such as Reasons, Pro-Tools, and CoolEdit Pro just to name a few. I first began with FL Studio a few years back (I don’t remember the version, but at this time, 99% of plugins were free). If you’re a first timer, or looking to start a new hobby, or just want to have some fun, FL Studio is where it’s at, hands down. My current setup consists of an MPC5000, FLStudio (latest version) and a Roland F6. FLStudio is my main brain, the MPC is my drum machine and of course the Roland F6 is my keyboard for natural sounds.
        <br>
    </br>
        Three reasons why I will NEVER stop using FLStudio
        <br>
    </br>
        <br>*Not sure if this is true or not, but it seems as if every other music production software uses the basis of FLStudio, meaning if you can work FLStudio, you can work them all.
        <br>*Versitility
        <br>*Compatibility
    </br>

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Why Dev/Ops</h2>
    I was first introduced to the profession of engineering while working for a company called FabTech in the photolithography room.  I was responsible for tunning the equipment that etched patterns into the silicon waffers.  While working 12.5 hours each day, 3-5 days a week while being a full time college student (12 hours), I wanted to get more hands on with the technology.  I enrolled in Computer Design and Electrical Engineerng at UMKC and long story short, I ended up having a focus in Machine Learning and Supervised Learning.  Upon graduation of my BS, I had to make a grave decision.  Stay in school and obtain my MS or take my new offered position at Cerner Corp.  Well, I took the job and thats how I landed in Dev/Ops.

        I was given Will’s information three weeks prior to my wedding date as a videographer who could recapture our wedding day. I was nervous as I lived in Houston, TX yet our wedding was taking place in Kansas City, KS. Will met with me for an hour conversation to address all my concerns regarding my wedding and frequent late responses to emails/text. The one thing I will never forget is that he asked about what my needs were, he was very interested in ensuring that my vision for my wedding was made a reality. On Friday the day before our wedding he met at the venue to visualize how he and his team would set up to get the best lighting and understand the layout of the venue. I was truly thankful for his insight and his professionalism.
        The day of my wedding he arrived on time and dressed professionally which I was truly grateful for. He interacted with my guest and he made me laugh although I was a nervous wreck so that my face didn’t appear frightened in our wedding video. 
        When it came time to deliver us our sneak peek I was blown away at the intimate moments he captured of our love. It was like we were living that moment all over again. The greatest memory I will cherish is the video of my daughter and I. He chose an adorable song that I never heard of but signified the meaning and love that I have for her. I am forever grateful for his professionalism, his ability to deliver on time as promised and listening to the demands of a bridezilla.
        
        Have a lovely and productive week!</p><br>
